in order to check whether node is installed or not 
we can use the following command 
    command - node --version // in my case i have installed v14.16.1

if you dont have node installed on your local computer then you can install it by going to nodejs website and install the stable version and not the latest version. (LTS)

sometimes after installing you need to restart the machine then only you can use node.
then you can again check the version by 
    command - node --version 

commands - npm init - intialize the node package
then you are asked to give details about the project.

command - npm install express mongoose dotenv cors 
the packages you want to install can be given space seperated.
if you want you can give them one by one or few.

head over to the "https://npmjs.com/package/" and search the above packages and read the documentation as much as you can in order to improve the knowledge.

you can also create the folder called models and route in order to store the routes and models.

Now we need to create the file server.js
