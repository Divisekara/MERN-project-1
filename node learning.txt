in order to check whether node is installed or not 
we can use the following command 
    command - node --version // in my case i have installed v14.16.1

if you dont have node installed on your local computer then you can install it by going to nodejs website and install the stable version and not the latest version. (LTS)

sometimes after installing you need to restart the machine then only you can use node.
then you can again check the version by 
    command - node --version
